# DLfoldercleaner
Python project to keep the Downloads folder in check

## Motivation
When migrating user information to a new install I observed that the Downloads folder tends to be the heaviest part. 
People, like me, lacking a strict file discipline tend to accumulate files in the Download folder and clutter their main drive needlessly. As making a big spring cleaning is tedious, I would much prefer to treat a handful of files regularly. Ideally a script would propose files to delete from time to time.

## Status
Getting and exploring data: done

Next steps will be writing the executable script.

## Tech used
Python & Jupyter Notebooks
